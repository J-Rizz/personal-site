        <h2 class="story-text-heading">01/ Exploring the World</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">Thanks to my dad's talent and hard work, I was lucky enough to travel and see the world as a kid. Seeing life beyong the borders of Slovakia awoken my desire and determination to learn, get out there and achieve something bigger than myself.<p>

        <h2 class="story-text-heading">02/ GBAS - Bilingual high school</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">GBAS is a truly special place. Studying in English was the ticket abroad I needed. More importantly though, the lifelong friends, inspiring teachers and a strong feeling of community I found there shaped my life ever since.<p>

      <div class="story-image-container story-image-3 grid-col-3-4">
        <h2 class="story-text-heading">03/ EHL, Switzerland</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">EHL was an eye-opener. It was an introduction to the world of business, hard work and responsibility. It was one of the most intense and formative periods of my life.<p>

        <h2 class="story-text-heading">04/ Co-founding a start-up</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">Initially working nights and weekends alongside a full time job, I set out on roller coaster of successes and failures with a team of wonderful people by my side. Pursuing this vision was a giant leap of faith and I am glad I had the guts to do it.<p>

        <h2 class="story-text-heading">05/ Move to Barcelona</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">Leaving the comfort and familiarity of the life I’ve built up in Lausanne over 7 years was hard, but it was one of the best things I’ve ever done. Barcelona is pulsing with life, it is an inspiring and wonderful city of opportunity and endless inspiration.<p>

        <h2 class="story-text-heading">06/ Becoming a PM</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">Co-founders of start-ups rarely have a fixed job description. They simply do whatever needs to get done. As it happens, I’ve gradually taken up most of what a dedicated PM would (and some on top of it) and I found my passion in this role.<p>

      <div class="story-image-container story-image-7 grid-col-1-4">
        <h2 class="story-text-heading">07/ Learning to code</h2>
        <p class="story-text-paragraph">I’ve always been passionate about tech, got into UX/UI design as a PM and learned a great deal about web development on the job, but still felt like a piece of the puzzle was missing. So I’m now learning how to bring my ideas, designs and specs to life.<p>
