I take charge of the product design and management for all our projects. As a co-founder and resident designer, I also created IMAGO’s visual identity and  website.</p>

        <p class="project-page-subtitle">In a market saturated with traditional dev agency services, clear communication of IMAGO’s unique positioning as a “start-up for hire” was critical. My task was to make every pixel of IMAGO website brim with our passion for fostering true innovation.</p>

        <h2 class="project-page-heading">Logo and colour scheme</h2>
        <p class="project-page-paragraph">IMAGO’s understated aesthetic and toned-down primary colour scheme that represent the simplicity and directness of our approach to building digital products is enlivened by vivid yellow and red secondary colours, which stand for our energy, speed and can-do attitude.</p>

        <h2 class="project-page-heading">Brochure website</h2>
        <p class="project-page-paragraph">In the spirit of build-measure-learn, I’ve put together a simple brochure website in Wix, which has already gone through a few content and design iterations based on the feedback collected during sales meetings. A case study detailing our work on Helfy, our flagship project, has been added to conclude the rapid iterations phase and in preparation for me to implement a fully responsive and optimised version of the website in Webflow.</p>

        <p class="project-page-paragraph">As a resident designer at IMAGO, I not only create brand identities and interfaces for our clients’ applications if the project requires it - my role is also to set internal design standards and provide templates for presentations, documents and promotional materials that are consistent with the IMAGO brand identity.</p>
