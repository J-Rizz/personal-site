We also give presentations and workshops on various topics related to entrepreneurship and building digital products. As one of the co-founders, I created N68’s visual identity, promotional documents, presentation style and design guidelines.</p>

        <p class="project-page-subtitle">Network 68 tries to stand out among many established accelerator programmes by offering a truly personal, hands-on attitude by young, dynamic and still active entrepreneurs. My role was to translate these values into a visual style that speaks to every young entrepreneur out there.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="project-page-heading">Logo and colour scheme</h2>
        <p class="project-page-paragraph">The brand identity of Network 68 revolves around “connecting the dots” - both in terms of helping founders understand how to drive their business towards success and in connecting the right people within the start-up ecosystem to share their knowledge and create value for each other. Colour palette is bold, young and diverse, like the founders we take under our wings.</p>

        <h2 class="project-page-heading">Website and promotional materials</h2>
        <p class="project-page-paragraph">As a grassroots project we work on in our spare time, we decided to keep N68 largely under the radar. The few promotional materials we use are a website outlining our services (currently in development) and 1-page introduction documents, which are easy to share via email or present during a meeting.</p>

        <h2 class="project-page-heading">Presentation templates and course materials</h2>
        <p class="project-page-paragraph">N68 co-founders run a variety of courses and workshops on topics related to entrepreneurship and building digital products. To ensure a consistent and engaging visual style, I have created presentations that set the style and serve as a guide for the rest of the team to follow when expanding on their portfolio of courses.</p>
